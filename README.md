# WebAssembly Hello World

At this writing, this repository contains two (extremely) simple (as far as programming goes, which is all complex on some level) c and cpp sources (let's insert another interrupting parenthetical here!) which may be transpiled to JavaScript .asm and further to WebAssembly .wasm files (with supporting .js hooks and .html files to load them), and run directly by opening the HTML files in supporting browsers (I am aware of only firefox working at this writing) (let's throw in a sixth parenthetical just for kicks and giggles!).

## Installation and usage

See the comments in webAssemble.sh and the lines of code in the file to set up a Web Assembly transpile environment and to transpile the c and cpp sources.

# LICENSE

Whatever here can't be construed as Public Domain already (super simple, fundamental examples), I wrote and release into the Public Domain.
